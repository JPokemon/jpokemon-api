.. java:type:: public interface AbilityEffect

   Provides an interface for effects that can be added to abilities. Since in practice these effects are so varied, this interface has no methods of its own, and you can implement it in any fashion you like. Or not at all, if you wish to implement individual abilities in the engine itself.
