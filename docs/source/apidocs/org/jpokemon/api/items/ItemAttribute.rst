ItemAttribute
=============

.. java:package:: org.jpokemon.api.items
   :noindex:

.. java:type:: public interface ItemAttribute

   Provides an interface for `attributes` that can be added to items. At this time, attributes have no common features, so in theory anything at all could implement this.
